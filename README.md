# Git Assignment - JesJH
a. What is an issue?
Issue is an item you can create in a repository to plan, discuss and track work and is used
to communicate with others.
 
b. What is a pull request?
Pull request is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch to another.
It allows collaborators to review and discuss proposed set of changes before integrating to
main codebase.

c. How do I open up a pull request?
On the Github website, go to the main repository. From the branch menu, select the branch
that contains the commits you are trying to review. Click on the button at the top that says
"Compare & pull request" to compare what changes have been made in the request.

d. Give me a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository.
On Github.com, go to the repository you want to give collaborators access to. Click on
'Settings' right next to the 'Insights' button. This takes you to a new page. On the left
side of the page, under 'Access', click on 'Collaborators'.This will prompt you to type in
your Github password. After entering your password, click on 'Add People' and add collaborators
to your repository using either their email address, full name or Github username.
